# Summary and Conclusions

Over the past few decades, the calculation of free-energy landscapes has
evolved from a niche activity within molecular thermodynamics to a
standard component of molecular simulation workflows, driven by
increasing computing power and a proliferation of established
algorithms. At the same time, each method has its own assumptions and
subtleties, and no single approach is universally applicable, so it can
be difficult for newcomers to navigate this landscape. This review aims
to provide a structured overview of the main families of methods and key
references, while also highlighting how emerging machine-learning
approaches are extending the scope of free-energy calculations.

By linking statistical mechanics with molecular simulations, we connect
microscopic configurations to macroscopic thermodynamic observables,
supporting the growing use of molecular modelling in chemical and
biochemical engineering (Burcham et al. 2024). We show how FESs can be
utilized to map equilibrium probabilities into interpretable
representations of stability, and how their meaning depends on the
choice of CVs that capture the essential transformation coordinates.
Machine learning now enhances FES calculations by discovering CVs,
optimizing biases, and learning mean forces while preserving
thermodynamic consistency, providing exciting new research avenues and
methodological improvements. The principles summarized here aim to equip
readers with a transferable foundation for applying and advancing
molecular simulation as a quantitative design tool in molecular and
process engineering.
