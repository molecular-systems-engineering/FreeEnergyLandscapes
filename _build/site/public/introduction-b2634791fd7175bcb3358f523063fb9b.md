# Introduction

Free Energy Surfaces (FESs) are low-dimensional representations of the
thermodynamic stability of *ensembles* of atomic configurations. As
such, FESs are valuable tools for mapping, rationalising, and navigating
the inherent complexity of high-dimensional datasets generated by
sampling atomistic models through simulations that build on Molecular
Dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques [@frenkel_understanding_2023; @tuckerman2023statistical; @chandler1987introduction]. 
Enabling a direct connection between the
microscopic world of atomic configurations and interpretable,
macroscopic observables, the ability to compute, read, and interpret
FESs is crucial for the quantitative interpretation of atomistic
simulation results, and thus also for the adoption of molecular
simulation techniques in an engineering context. Our goal in this review
is to provide a route to computing, reading, and interpreting FESs,
first by establishing the theoretical foundations, then by surveying
practical methods for their calculation, and finally by demonstrating
how modern machine learning enhances both the representation and
sampling of FESs. Section [sec:Theory](#sec:Theory) introduces the
statistical--mechanical basis of FESs, linking partition functions and
thermodynamic potentials to marginal probabilities, and showing how
projections onto collective variables (CVs) yield interpretable
landscapes. Key aspects include ergodicity, CV selection, and how FESs
provide barrier heights and equilibrium constants. Section
[sec:Computing](#sec:Computing) outlines practical computational
techniques aimed at evaluating FESs from molecular simulations. Section
[sec:MLCVs](#sec:MLCVs) explores machine learning in the analysis and
calculation of FESs, providing an overview of recent developments, from
machine-learned CVs and variational committor models to ML-enhanced
transition-path sampling, and highlights how learning and sampling can
be integrated to improve the representation and exploration of molecular
processes.
