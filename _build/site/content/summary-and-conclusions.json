At the same time, each method has its own assumptions and\nsubtleties, and no single approach is universally applicable, so it can\nbe difficult for newcomers to navigate this landscape. This review aims\nto provide a structured overview of the main families of methods and key\nreferences, while also highlighting how emerging machine-learning\napproaches are extending the scope of free-energy calculations.","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1},"end":{"line":3,"column":1}},"key":"QEZ5hHXg1t"}],"key":"Jqs7T0c7mF"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1},"end":{"line":27,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"By linking statistical mechanics with molecular simulations, we connect\nmicroscopic configurations to macroscopic thermodynamic observables,\nsupporting the growing use of molecular modelling in chemical and\nbiochemical engineering ","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1},"end":{"line":14,"column":1}},"key":"n0sa1bUKzP"},{"type":"citeGroup","kind":"parenthetical","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1},"end":{"line":14,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"cite","identifier":"digitaldesign","label":"digitaldesign","kind":"parenthetical","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":233},"end":{"line":14,"column":247}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Burcham ","key":"Jp3oo3yYKP"},{"type":"emphasis","children":[{"type":"text","value":"et al.","key":"KfaEj49sma"}],"key":"bu4zqOD4DN"},{"type":"text","value":", 2024","key":"gRLkOKuO48"}],"enumerator":"1","key":"Y8ZAdw0PEs"}],"key":"g3wE6QlbFV"},{"type":"text","value":". We show how FESs can be\nutilized to map equilibrium probabilities into interpretable\nrepresentations of stability, and how their meaning depends on the\nchoice of CVs that capture the essential transformation coordinates.\nMachine learning now enhances FES calculations by discovering CVs,\noptimizing biases, and learning mean forces while preserving\nthermodynamic consistency, providing exciting new research avenues and\nmethodological improvements.
