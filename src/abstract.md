Free energy surfaces (FESs) provide a rigorous yet intuitive framework
to connect molecular configurations with macroscopic thermodynamic
observables. By projecting high-dimensional molecular information onto
carefully chosen collective variables, FESs reveal the stability,
metastability, and transition pathways that underpin molecular
transformations. This review aims to establish a connection between the
statistical mechanical foundations that enable the calculation of FESs
and their practical applications in molecular simulations. A key
objective of this review is to provide interested practitioners with the
necessary background for understanding and, perhaps, experimenting with
methods that integrate Statistical Mechanics foundations with modern
Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence approaches. In
particular, we introduce the concepts necessary to grasp how ML can
"close the loop" between sampling and representation of molecular
systems, enabling FESs and rate estimates with minimal manual tuning.
Throughout, we provide case studies that illustrate free energy
landscapes associated with phase transformations, conformational changes
and folding, ligand binding/unbinding, and self-assembly. Taken
together, the review offers a coherent workflow---from theory to
algorithms to contemporary developments---for building and interpreting
FESs that translate molecular mechanisms into quantitative predictions.
