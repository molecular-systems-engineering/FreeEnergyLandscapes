Free Energy Surfaces (FESs) are low-dimensional representations of the
thermodynamic stability of *ensembles* of atomic configurations. As
such, FESs are valuable tools for mapping, rationalising, and navigating
the inherent complexity of high-dimensional datasets generated by
sampling atomistic models through simulations that build on Molecular
Dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques (**frenkel_understanding_2023?**;
**tuckerman2023statistical?**; **chandler1987introduction?**). Enabling
a direct connection between the microscopic world of atomic
configurations and interpretable, macroscopic observables, the ability
to compute, read, and interpret FESs is crucial for the quantitative
interpretation of atomistic simulation results, and thus also for the
adoption of molecular simulation techniques in an engineering context.
Our goal in this review is to provide a route to computing, reading, and
interpreting FESs, first by establishing the theoretical foundations,
then by surveying practical methods for their calculation, and finally
by showing how modern machine learning augments both representation and
sampling of FESs. We begin in Section
[sec:Theory](#sec:Theory) by laying out the
statistical-mechanical basis of FESs linking partition functions,
thermodynamic potentials, and ensemble probabilities, and how projecting
high-dimensional configuration spaces onto suitable collective variables
(CVs) yields interpretable landscapes. In particular, this discussion
focuses on the role of ergodicity, the definition and choice of CVs, and
the theoretical foundations underlying key pieces of information
gathered from FESs, such as barrier heights in the context of
Generalized Transition State Theory, and the calculation of equilibrium
constants. Section [sec:Computing](#sec:Computing) turns to computation.
We outline how FESs are estimated in practice—unbiased vs biased
sampling, reweighting, and free-energy estimators—covering umbrella
sampling, thermodynamic integration, metadynamics, and its modern
variants. Throughout, we emphasise how biased design and estimator
choice affect quantitative fidelity.

Building on these foundations, Section
[sec:MLCVs](#sec:MLCVs) addresses the rapidly growing
interface between machine learning and methods for the calculation of
free-energy surfaces. We first survey machine-learned CVs (MLCVs)—from
unsupervised embeddings to variational and graph-based, symmetry-aware
architectures—and discuss practical issues such as gradient norms and
reproducibility under bias. We then examine machine learning the
committor and its variational formulations, before highlighting
ML-enhanced transition-path sampling, where learned surrogates
accelerate discovery of reactive trajectories while preserving
thermodynamic consistency. Together, these advances demonstrate how
learning and sampling can be integrated in closed loops that enhance the
representation, exploration, and inference of FESs.
