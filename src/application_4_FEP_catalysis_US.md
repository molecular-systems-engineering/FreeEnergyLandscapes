### Free-energy guided enzyme design for plastic biodegradation with Umbrella Sampling

A recent example of the traditional use of US is the study of the
catalitic mechanism of PETase by Jerves et al.[@jerves2021reaction].
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most widely used
plastics, and the discovery of Ideonella sakaiensis PETase suggested a
biological solution to plastic recycling, but its catalytic mechanism is
difficult to understand. provided the first quantitative free-energy
description of PETase catalysis, mapping the full reaction cycle with
QM/MM umbrella sampling. Using carefully chosen bond-breaking/formation
reaction coordinates, they reconstructed the free-energy landscape of
the acylation and deacylation steps. Despite the absence of more modern
collective-variable discovery tools, the study showed that chemical
insight can still guide the selection of effective coordinates: the
resulting profiles shown in the figure below reproduced experimental
barriers (20.0 kcal/mol vs. 18--19 kcal/mol measured) and revealed a
concerted, tetrahedral transition state mechanism distinct from earlier
proposals. ![image](images/jerves.jpeg){width="0.65\\linewidth"}
