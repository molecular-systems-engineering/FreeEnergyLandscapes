### Discovering and Mapping Elusive Metastable States.[]{#sec:case-study-water label="sec:case-study-water"}

A particularly enlightening application of enhanced sampling methods in
the exploration of metastable states has concerned the debate revolving
around the existence of a first order phase transition (and an
associated critical point) between two putative forms of liquid water at
low temperature and high
pressure[@poole1992phase; @palmer2014metastable; @gallo2016water] The
two states, low density liquid (LDL) and high density liquid (HDL) have
a clearly different density, but density alone is not enough to clearly
resolve the free energy landscape, as it is not able to distinguish LDL
water from incipient crystallization into the nearest ice polymorph,
cubic ice. In their landmark study, Palmer and colleagues, using six
different sampling techniques (umbrella sampling MC, well-tempered
metadynamics, unconstrained MC, hybrid MC, parallel tempering MC, and
Hamiltonian exchange MC simulations) for robustness, showed that the two
liquid forms are separated by a $4 kT$ barrier, with finite-size scaling
characteristic of first-order transitions. Both liquid states are
metastable with respect to the cubic form of ice.

order ($Q_6\simeq 0.05)$ are separated by a barrier of about $4 kT$.

($Q_6\simeq 0.52)$. Contour lines are separated by $1 kT$
