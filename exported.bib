On the basis of a reasonable approximation to the superficial density of molecular pairs, the Lennard-Jones potential and the Eisenstein-Gingrich radial distribution function, the surface tension, surface energy, and the superficial density of matter, referred to the surface of tension, are calculated for liquid argon at 90{$^\circ$}K and compared with experiment. The positive value which is obtained for the superficial density, referred to the surface of tension, confirms the results of Tolman's quasi-thermodynamic theory and leads to the conclusion the surface tension of small drops decreases with increasing curvature.}

Lett. 48, 1818 (1982)], and Evans and Morriss [Chem. Phys. 77, 63 (1983)]; and (iii) Haile and Gupta [J. Chem. Phys. 79, 3067 (1983)] are examined analytically via calculating the equilibrium distribution functions and comparing them with that of the canonical ensemble. Except for effects due to momentum and angular momentum conservation, method (1) yields the rigorous canonical distribution in both momentum and coordinate space. Method (2) can be made rigorous in coordinate space, and can be derived from method (1) by imposing a specific constraint. Method (3) is not rigorous and gives a deviation of order N-1/2 from the canonical distribution (N the number of particles). The results for the constant temperature--constant pressure ensemble are similar to the canonical ensemble case.}
