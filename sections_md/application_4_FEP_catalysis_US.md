![ **Free energy landscapes of reactions in complex systems**\
**A.** A landmark use of metadynamics for reaction discovery from Cheng
et al. on CO reduction on copper (Cheng, Xiao, and Goddard III 2017).
Using ab initio molecular dynamics with explicit water and Blue Moon
refinement, they computed atomistic free-energy barriers and pathways.
At moderate potentials (U \> --0.6 V vs RHE, pH 7), ethylene dominates
via CO--CO coupling in an Eley--Rideal step ($\Delta G^\ddag = 0.69$
eV), while at more negative potentials hydrogen blocks sites, favoring
methane formation through a $^*$CHO intermediate. The study offers a
mechanistic basis for tuning Cu-based catalysts in electrochemical
CO$_2$ reduction. **B.** A recent example of the traditional use of US
is the study of the catalytic mechanism of PETase by Jerves et
al.(Jerves et al. 2021), providing the first quantitative free-energy
description of PETase catalysis by mapping the full reaction cycle with
QM/MM US. Despite the absence of more modern collective-variable
discovery tools, the study showed that chemical insight can guide the
selection of effective CVs. The FE profile reproduced experimental
barriers (20.0 kcal/mol vs. 18--19 kcal/mol measured) and revealed a
concerted, tetrahedral transition state mechanism distinct from earlier
proposals. []{#fig:reactions label="fig:reactions"}
