![ **Discovering and Mapping Elusive Metastable Phases of Water.** Two
FESs at different T and P for the ST2 model of water. **A.** The FES
shows the coexistence between liquid water and ice Ih at 2.6 kbar and
275 K. Ice and water are in equilibrium, hence their respective FES
minima have the same depth. **B.** FES in conditions where Ice is
stable, and liquid water is metastable (228.6 K, 2.4 kbar).
Interestingly, liquid water in these conditions is characterized by two
local minima at low and high density (Poole et al. 1992; Palmer et al.
2014; Gallo et al. 2016). In their landmark study, Palmer et al. used
six complementary sampling and Free Energy calculations techniques to
demonstrate that the two liquids are separated by a 4 $\kT$ barrier,
with finite-size scaling indicative of a first-order transition. At the
same time, both remain metastable relative to cubic ice. Figure
