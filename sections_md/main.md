+++ { "part": "abstract" }
Free energy surfaces (FESs) offer a unifying framework for understanding
molecular-level structures, transformations and thermodynamic stability.
They distill the complexity of atomistic simulations into interpretable
landscapes of metastable states, bridging molecular-level detail with
macroscopic observables. This review provides researchers in molecular
simulations, computational physical chemistry, and chemical engineering
with a conceptual and practical guide to computing and interpreting
FESs, from their statistical-mechanical foundations to modern machine
learning approaches that are transforming the sampling, representation
and analysis of molecular systems.
